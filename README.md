# Simple Platform Game With Godot

### Credit

- This project is made by following this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk&t=6230s&ab_channel=GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk&t=6230s&ab_channel=GDQuest)

### Note

- This is my first project made with Godot, just trying out the Game Engine.
- The implementation is pretty much the same but I refractored the logic and scenes to fix some buges.
